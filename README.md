## New Buffalo Physics Skate Park Website
This repository holds the code for the New Buffalo Physics Skate Park official website.  By scanning QR codes on the skate park, people can learn all about the physics of skateboarding and how it applies to the physics of everything else.  Calculating engines allow people to enter data, such as their weight, and use that data to determine how quickly they will be moving if they go down the side of a certain ramp.
